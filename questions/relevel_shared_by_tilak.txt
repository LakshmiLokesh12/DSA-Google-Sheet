RANGE SUM QUERY 2.0

Problem Statement

Amy has an array A of R-L+1 integers such that A1 = L, A2 = L+1, …. , AR-L+1 = R.

Anne gives her Q queries. Each query consists of two integers X and Y. Anne wants Amy to check if there exists at least one subsequence in A, such that the sum of subsequence lies between X and Y (both inclusive).

You are given T independent test cases.

NOTE: Subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. You can erase any elements, not necessarily going successively. The remaining elements preserve their order.

1 <= Q <= 10^5
1 <= L <= R <= 10^9
1 <= X<= Y <= 10^18
All input values are integers.
Input Format

First-line contains T.
First line of each test case consists of a three space separated integers integer Q, L and R.
Next Q lines of each test case consists of two space separated integers X and Y.

Explanation of Sample 1

For the first query, subsequence S = { A1, A2, A3} has sum 6 (A1+A2+A3 = 1+2+3 = 6). So, there is one possible subsequence whose sum lies between X = 6 and Y = 7.

For 2nd query, there is no possible subsequence.

/////////////////////////Q.8///////////
 Question Name: Optimal division
Problem Statement
Antonio and his girlfriend decided to move their relationship to the next level and bought an array from a nearby arrays shop(name of the shop). As you may have already guessed, both of them are programmers.

They define the value of an array as the number of unique elements it has. Like value of array [1,2,1,2,2,3] = 3 as it has 3 unique elements(1,2 and 3), value of array [1,2,3,4] = 4 and so on.

After a few days, their relationship went through a tough phase and they decided to break up with each other. While breaking up they also decided to break up the bought array among themselves.

To break up the array, they decided to split the elements of the array among themselves such that the total value of the final arrays they receive is as maximum as possible.

For this, they went to a nearby relationship counselor(you). Given the array, Antonio and his girlfriend bought, print the maximum possible total value of the final arrays they can achieve if they divide the elements of the bought array optimally.

Note :

It may be possible that one of them does not receive any element of the bought array.


Input Format

Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the bought array.

Explanation of Sample 1



They can divide the array elements as :

Antonio receives the 1st, 4th and 5th elements of the array.
His girlfriend receives rest of the elements i.e. 2nd, 3rd, and 6th.
Value of array Antonio receives = value of array [1,2,2] = 2

Value of array his girlfriend receives = value of array [2,1,3] = 3

Hence total value = 2+3 = 5. It can be proved that this is the maximum possible value.
